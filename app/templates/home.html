        <p>The Linguist's Kitchen is a teaching and learning tool designed for 
        introductory linguistics and language courses. It is meant to support classroom 
        instruction by guiding students in dissecting their own language(s). 

        <br><br>The Linguist's Kitchen will not give you any answers. It is designed only to 
        guide you in your own thinking, by providing a workspace where you can transcribe language 
        samples that you create, and guiding you through three levels 
        of syntactic analysis, including identifying:

        <br><br><b>parts of speech</b> (noun, verb, adjective, 
        pronoun, etc.)

        <br><b>phrase structure</b> (noun phrase, verb phrase, etc.)

        <br><b>grammatical function</b> (grammatical subject, grammatical 
        direct object, etc.)

        <br><br>For each sentence, The Linguist's Kitchen will generate a phrase structure grammar 
        based on your input, like the following: 
        <b><br><br>S &#8594; NP VP
        <br>NP &#8594; (Det) N
        <br>VP &#8594; V (NP)</b>

        <br><br>Bon app&eacute;tit!
        </p>
