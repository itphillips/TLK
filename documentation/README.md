# About

The Linguist's Kitchen is a teaching and learning tool designed for 
introductory linguistics and language courses. It is meant to support classroom 
instruction by guiding students in dissecting their own language(s). 

The Linguist's Kitchen will not give you any answers. It is designed only to 
guide you in your own thinking, by providing a workspace where you can transcribe language 
samples that you provide, and guiding you through three levels 
of syntactic analysis, including identifying:

**parts of speech** (noun, verb, adjective, 
pronoun, etc.)
**phrase structure** (noun phrase, verb phrase, adjectival 
phrase, etc.)
**grammatical function** (grammatical subject, direct object, etc.)

For each sentence, The Linguist's Kitchen will generate a phrase structure grammar 
based on your input, like the following: 
**S --> NP VP**
**NP --> (Det) N**
**VP --> V (NP)**

The purpose of The Linguist's Kitchen is to support learning. The first aim is to provide a user-friendly interface that supports students in objectifying languages they interact with at home or in their daily lives, by creating a space where each language sample is treated as an object to be analyzed and is separated from the historical, social, and political views associated with the language and its speakers that may impede objective thinking about the language as a whole. The second aim is to  provide detailed guidance during each step of the analysis process to help beginning students sort out fundamental  ideas and develop the conceptual framework that form the basis of learning in linguistics. Lastly, this tool is designed to promote a student-centered learning experience where students study linguistic principles by analyzing content that they generate. The idea is to strengthen student engagement with the subject matter by making it relevant to their lives outside of the classroom and by granting power to students as authorities on the subject and creators of knowledge.

# The Future
As The Linguist's Kitchen is an experiment in pedagogy, not an exercise in writing elegant code, and I am a linguist, not a programmer, there are a number of bugs and hacky fixes in the program. Please excuse these issues; I'll work on cleaning them up in the next round of development. If you'd like to fix them, please submit a pull request.
