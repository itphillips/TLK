Welcome to the Linguist's Kitchen!
*****************************************************************************************

This is a web-based app, designed to help guide students in intro to language/linguistics 
courses in dissecting their own language(s). 

The goal is to create a workspace where students can type in language samples recorded 
at home or in the community and then guide them through three levels of analysis 
on each individual sentence from the recording.

The first level helps students identify and label parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, 
pronoun, etc.)

The second level helps students identify and label phrase structure (a more abstract 
grouping--noun phrase, verb phrase, adjectival phrase, etc.)

The third level helps students identify and label grammatical function (a more abstract 
grouping--subject, object)

Once users have tagged a number of sentences with these three levels of info, the app 
will generate a phrase structure (PS) grammar based on the input.

A PS grammar is a list of transformation rules like: 
S = NP VP
NP = (Det) N
VP = V (NP)
etc.

The main idea is to help students see that their own language(s) is/are systematic and 
rule-based.
